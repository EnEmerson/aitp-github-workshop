### Create a repo

### Basic commands

	* git clone - get a repository for the first time onto your local machine
	* git pull - grab the latest version of the project from the remote repo
	* git add - adding your recent changes to your local git object
	* git commit - committing the changes you made to be pushed to the remote repo
	* git push - pushing the changes from your local machine to the remote repo
	* git status - returns useful information about your current stage

### Advanced commands

![merge-conflicts-meme]()

#### Probably don't use these yet unless you are very comfortable using git, familiar with the Vim console, and are ok with searching around online for long periods of time looking for solutions to very tedious problems:

	* git merge - combining multiple versions of your project
	* git rm - removes files from your repository
